# PPG-BioParameter-Estimation
Improvement of the accuracy of wearable optical devices may be achieved by a model that integrate a characterization of optical signals with the skin properties and its combination with Deep Learning methods. This chapter focuses on presenting the development and design of the Noninvasive Light-Based Platform and Signal Processing required to get correct PPG signal from a base photometric device.
